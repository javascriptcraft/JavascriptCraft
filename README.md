##  Project Concept

  
##  MVP
We will build a platform where we can keep collection of custom UI elements/components in different categories.

For example in `Select` category, we will have different types of Select components such as `Simple Select`, `Searchable Select`, `Multi-Select`.

Each component will have different options listed below it.

  

- View code

- Open code in editor (either external editor like codepen or our cloud editor)

- Save/Bookmark Component

- Discuss (which will open a discussion page like in guthub issues)

- Upvote/Like

- Component Creator account/ top contributors ??? (TBD)

## Version 2.

In v2, we will allow users to create their own components and keep them either private or public. And they can decide to publish thier component by submitting their code to our featured components. And they will be published after reviewing.

  

##### FAQ:
Q:  Is this similar to `Bootstrap`?

A:  No, all of these components will be independent component and you don’t need to download the CSS framework to use them.

You can view its code, play with it in editor and discuss about it if you have questions about it. You can copy the code and use it in your projects and modify it to your needs. You can also raise pull request if it has a bug or if you make improvements to it.

  

Q: What stack will be used?

A: Website will be built in `ReactJS` with Typescript. But since each component will have examples in `Vanilla JavaScript`, `ReactJS`, `VueJS`  and `AngularJS`, you can still contribute and learn no matter what stack will be.  Backend technologies are expected to be `NodeJs`, `ExpressJS`, `MangoDB` and `GraphQL` (TBB)

  

## Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `yarn start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  

### `yarn test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br  />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

### `yarn build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br  />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br  />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `yarn eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

  

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
